**Comprehensive Requirements Document for Todo Application with Real-time Collaboration**

---

### 1. Project Overview and Objectives

**Project Overview:**  
Develop a cloud-based Todo List application that enables users to create, manage, and sync tasks in real-time across multiple devices and collaborators. The system should support real-time collaboration features such as concurrent editing, task assignment, and status updates, with a focus on a seamless user experience and robust data synchronization.

**Objectives:**  
- Provide users with a simple, intuitive interface to create and manage todos  
- Enable real-time collaboration so multiple users can work on shared lists simultaneously  
- Ensure data consistency, security, and scalability in multi-user environments  
- Support core functionalities within the MVP, with scope for future enhancements (e.g., notifications, task comments)

### 2. User Personas and Use Cases

**User Personas:**

| Persona            | Description                                            | Needs                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Solo User          | Individual users managing personal tasks            | Easy task creation, organization, and completion |
| Collaborator       | Teams or groups managing shared work                 | Real-time updates, task assignment, notifications|
| Admin/Manager    | Users overseeing multiple shared lists               | User management, access control                 |

**Use Cases:**

- Create, edit, delete tasks individually or in bulk
- Share task lists with collaborators
- Update task status (todo, in-progress, done) in real-time
- Collaboratively edit task details
- Receive real-time notifications on task changes
- Manage user access and permissions

### 3. Detailed User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

**Epic 1: User Authentication and Authorization**

- **User Story 1:**  
  *As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely so that I can access my personalized Todo lists.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Users can create an account with email and password  
  - Users can log in securely with authenticated sessions  
  - Passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms  
  - Session timeout is enforced after inactivity

- **User Story 2:**  
  *As a user, I want to invite other users to collaborate on my list with specific permissions.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Users can send invite links or email invitations  
  - Invited users accept or decline invitations  
  - Permissions (view-only, edit) are assigned based on invitation

**Epic 2: Task Management**

- **User Story 3:**  
  *As a user, I want to create a new task with a title, description, due date, and priority.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - User can input task details and save  
  - Task appears immediately in the list with correct details  
  - Validation enforces required fields (e.g., title)

- **User Story 4:**  
  *As a user, I want to edit and delete tasks.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Edits update task details in real-time for all collaborators  
  - Deletion removes task immediately from all views  
  - Actions are confirmed with undo options within a grace period

- **User Story 5:**  
  *As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed or pending.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Checkbox or toggle updates status instantly for all users on the same list  
  - Status changes are timestamped and visible to collaborators

**Epic 3: Real-time Collaboration**

- **User Story 6:**  
  *As a collaborator, I want to see real-time updates when others modify the shared list.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Changes (add/edit/delete/update status) propagate instantly via WebSocket or SignalR  
  - No manual refresh required

- **User Story 7:**  
  *As a user, I want to see who is currently viewing or editing the list.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Presence indicators show active collaborators in real-time  
  - Multiple users can work simultaneously without conflicts

**Epic 4: User Interface & Experience**

- **User Story 8:**  
  *As a user, I want an intuitive, responsive UI to manage my tasks seamlessly across devices.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Mobile and desktop views are responsive  
  - Actions are quick and visually clear  
  - Drag-and-drop task reordering is supported in the web interface

### 4. Feature Prioritization and MVP Scope

**MVP Features (Prioritized):**

1. User registration, login, and secure session management  
2. Creating, editing, and deleting tasks  
3. Sharing lists via invitation links with permissions  
4. Real-time synchronization of list updates across users/devices  
5. Task status updates and filtering (e.g., show only completed tasks)  
6. Basic user presence indicators and collaborator management

**Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**

- Commenting on tasks  
- Notifications and activity feeds  
- Task due date reminders and push notifications  
- Advanced permission management and roles  
- Offline mode with sync reconciliation
